		<h3   style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center;"> <big>LOVE</big> is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant, It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth.
         The world could be a better place to live in if there’s love. To love is to sacrifice. The best an individual could do is to Love
        another fellow individual just as how he or she loves him or herself.</h3><br></br>

       <h6 style="font-size: 30px;" <u> More than friends.</u> 
        <i> Love is like the wild rose-briar,
         Friendship like the holly-tree 
         The holly is dark when the rose-briar blooms 
         But which will bloom most constantly? /
         The wild rose-briar is sweet in spring,
         Its summer blossoms scent the air;
         Yet wait till winter comes again
         And who will call the wild-briar fair?
          Then scorn the silly rose-wreath now
           And deck thee with the holly’s sheen,
          That when December blights thy brow
          He still may leave thy garland green.</i> </h6>
